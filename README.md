Hello Sir,

I am an economics student from India.
I need help to run few coding using selenium. 

I want to write code for automating the browser (prefably chrome for mac/windows both) about the acitivity which I wish to automate do using selenium.


1.) Suppose there are two male login accounts that are distinguishable on basis of physical attributes i.e. physically fit and physically challenged.


2.) I wish to do some activity on instagram using information of these two user logins. 
For instance the activities would be  liking and commenting on different pages on instagram.


 3.) I wish to make the allocation of physical attributes to be allocated between the two user logins random. 
In other words if X is physically fit and y is physically challenged in the first act (data instances) of liking and commenting then in the 2nd act (data instances) x will be physically challenged and y would be physically fit. 
*The difficulty here is that want to make the physically attributes to be static for pages i.e. if the pages looks back the account it should see the same physical attributes that was allocated to the user logins at the time of likings and commenting on the page. 
Therefore, for this I think we can create four accounts like X1, X2, Y1, Y2. Where X1 (Phys. Fit) and X2 (Phys. Challenged) are of same person but the activity of liking and commenting on a particular page is done by single X i.e. either X1 or X2. Similarly for Y to we have Y1 (Phys. Fit) and Y2 (Phys. Challenged) and liking and commenting to a particular done by single account. Hence making the allocation random.
